                <p>The tiger is one of the worlds most iconic animals, but thanks to humans tigers are now endangered.
                    As of 2022 there are sadly more tigers in captivity than left in the wild. However there is hope! Thanks to
                    the effort of many organizations including the World Wildlife Foundation, tigers all around the world are 
                    earning protected status, and it is hopeful that one day their numbers may begin to heal and grow again.
                </p>
                <p>The majestic and awe inspiring tiger sadly has always been a prime target for hunters as their famous striped skins 
                    have historically fetched high prices. In 1977, just before international conservation efforts took effect, a 
                    tiger skin fetched on average US$4,250 on the market. In addition their other parts have always been highly valuable 
                    as well with their bones and fangs demanding high prices on the market. This value combined with tigers and humans
                    having notoriously dangerous interactions have led to their numbers being culled in large amounts. In modern times
                    however the animals are increasingly seen with respect and have been granted protection in many countries.
